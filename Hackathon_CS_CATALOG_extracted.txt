foundations and the drive to delve deeper into computing. Students must be seeking a Bachelor of Science in
Computer Science or a Bachelor of Science in Applied Computer Science and must apply for entry into the CS
Honors Program after completing 12 credits of CS courses. Applicants must meet GPA requirements to enter into
the CS Honors Program.
BS/Accelerated MS Degree Programs
These programs are for students interested in immediately continuing on to graduate studies in computer science:
BS/Accelerated MS in Computer Science
BS/Accelerated MS in Information Security and Assurance
BS/Accelerated MS in Information Systems
BS/Accelerated MS in Software Engineering
Admission Requirements: Students in the BS program in computer science can apply for a BS/Accelerated MS
program if they have earned 90 undergraduate credits with an overall GPA of at least 3.30. Students must have
completed CS 310, CS 330, and CS 367.
Degree Requirements: Students must complete 144 credits that satisfy requirements for the BS program as well
as those for the MS program, with 6 credits overlap. Students register for 6 credits of CS 500-level basic courses in
place of the corresponding CS 400-level courses required for the undergraduate degree requirements. For example,
students in the Accelerated MS CS must register for two of the following courses: CS 540, 550, 551, 555, 571,
583, and 584 in place of the corresponding 400-level courses. Students complete all MS requirements as specified
by the respective MS degree program and apply the two courses from the respective approved list toward their MS
requirements. Students are permitted to take additional graduate basic courses in their undergraduate programs. In
such cases, those classes cannot be counted towards requirements for the MS.
Degree Conferral: Students must apply to have the BS degree conferred the semester before they expect to
complete the BS requirements. At the completion of the MS requirements, a master’s degree is granted.
Additional information about these and other degree options is available from the Computer Science Department
office or at http://catalog.gmu.edu.
